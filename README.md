Portfolio website - Saumya Vilas Roy
This website is designed in jekyll
If you want to change any changes in project, you can go to the data and projects.yml and copy one of the project and paste it as it is and change the info and you can mention to which section it should be added in the last variable.
same with my works
if you want to change any other thing, you can directly change em in index and mostly no other thing changes any visible thing except .yml file.
If you want some thing like your name or email to be changed, please change it in the .yml file and it will be changed everywhere.
and you can other pdf's or any thing in data

 I'll add a detailed explaination in a short time.
